netrics: a Python 3.7 package for econometric analysis of networks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package includes a variety of functions for the econometric analysis of
network data. It will be expanded with additional functionality over time.
There are cross dependencies between this package and the ipt package. Users
wishing to use netrics will also need to use ipt.

This package is offered "as is", without warranty, implicit or otherwise. While I would
appreciate bug reports, suggestions for improvements and so on, I am unable to provide any
meaningful user-support. Please e-mail me at bgraham@econ.berkeley.edu

Please cite both the code and the underlying source articles listed below when using this 
code in your research.
