The Anaconda distribution of Python, available at https://www.continuum.io/downloads, comes bundled with all the scientific computing packages used in this notebook. The notebook additionally uses the _ipt_ and _netrics_ modules that I have created.

Details on how to do this are provided in the markdown boxes below.\n",

All I ask is that you cite both the underlying research as well as this codebase (see below for a suggested citation). If you find any errors in what follows I would be happy to hear about them. While I am not able to provide meaningful support for potential users of this code, I am willing to answer questions when/if I have the bandwidth to so.\n",

For an informal introduction to the package see this [blog post](http://bryangraham.github.io/econometrics/networks/2016/09/15/netrics-module.html). The blog post also includes links to additional resources. The Python 3.6 version of the package is still under development, but currently available code can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/bryangraham/netrics. Once a basic level of functionality and reliability is in place I will register it on PyPi. The **netrics** package uses some functionality from the **ipt** package; so this latter package is loaded as well. You can read more about the **ipt** package at this [blog post](http://bryangraham.github.io/econometrics/causal/inference/2016/05/15/IPT-module.html).\n",

First I print out the mean and median bias of the estimated interaction coefficient, $\\hat{\\beta}_{wx}$. This is in rows 1 and 2 below, with the different samples sizes corresponding to each column (from smallest to largest). I also compute the standard deviation of $\\hat{\\beta}_{wx}$ across the $5,000$ Monte Carlo replications. I use both the sample standard deviation (row 3) and a robust measure (row 4). The two estimates a very close except for the smallest sample size. The paper reports only the robust measure. The mapping of the numbers printed out below to the tables in the paper is specified in the printed output."
